       The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small <span class="text-blue-600">domesticated carnivorous mammal</span>. It is the only domesticated species of the family <span class="text-blue-600">Felidae</span>. Advances in archaeology and <span class="text-blue-600">genetics </span> have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the <span class="text-blue-600">Near East</span> around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as <span class="text-blue-600">mice</span> and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular 
predator.
Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, <span class="text-blue-600">hissing</span>, growling, grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives <span class="text-blue-600">pheromones</span>. Cat intelligence is evident in its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems.
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. <span class="text-blue-600">Domestic cats</span> are bred and shown at cat fancy events as registered pedigreed cats. Population control includes spaying and neutering, but pet abandonment has exploded the global feral cat population, which has driven the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.
Domestic cats occur across the globe, though their popularity as pets varies by region. Out of the estimated 600 million cats worldwide, 400 million reside in Asia, including 58 million pet cats in <span class="text-blue-600">China</span>. The <span class="text-blue-600">United States</span> leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million cats. In the United Kingdom, approximately 10.9 million domestic cats are kept as pets.

          <span style="background-color:#FEF6E7;">Cats have excellent <span class="text-blue-600">night vision</span> and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision.[53]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a <span class="text-blue-600">tapetum lucidum</span>, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.</span>[68] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without <span class="text-blue-600">chromatic aberration</span>.[69] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.[70] The domestic cat has rather poor <span class="text-blue-600">color vision</span> and only two types of <span class="text-blue-600">cone cells</span>, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited.[71] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.[72] Cats have a <span class="text-blue-600">nictitating membrane</span>, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.

          The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[73] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 <span class="text-blue-600">octaves</span>, compared to about 9 octaves for humans and dogs.[74][75] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the <span class="text-blue-600">pinnae</span>, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect <span class="text-blue-600">ultrasound</span>, including ultrasonic calls from rodent prey.[76][77] Research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of familiar people's locations based on hearing their voices.[78]
